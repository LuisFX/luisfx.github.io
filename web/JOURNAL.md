## Issues and Fixes
- **Routing Issue (FIXED)**: The application's routing was not working because the MainLayout component was not properly wrapped with the React.router component. Fixed by implementing the router with the correct syntax for Feliz.Router 4.0.0:
  - Changed implementation to use `React.router` instead of custom wrapper
  - Used proper router.onUrlChanged and router.children properties
  - Used function composition `(State.fromUrl >> NavigateTo >> dispatch)` for the URL change handler
