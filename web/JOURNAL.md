## Issues and Fixes
- **Routing Issue (FIXED)**: The application's routing was not working because the MainLayout component was not properly wrapped with the React.router component. Fixed by implementing the router with the correct syntax for Feliz.Router 4.0.0:
  - Changed implementation to use `React.router` instead of custom wrapper
  - Used proper router.onUrlChanged and router.children properties
  - Used function composition `(State.fromUrl >> NavigateTo >> dispatch)` for the URL change handler

- **Typing Animation (FIXED)**: The code typing animation in the Home page was only working on first load and not resetting when the fragment changed. Fixed by:
  - Replaced System.Timers.Timer with React-friendly Browser.Dom.window.setTimeout
  - Added an isAnimating state to toggle the animation class
  - Implemented a three-step animation cycle:
    1. Remove animation class (setIsAnimating false)
    2. Change text content after a short delay
    3. Re-add animation class to restart the animation (setIsAnimating true)
  - Made the fragment transition smooth and continuous by adding dependency tracking for currentFragmentIndex
