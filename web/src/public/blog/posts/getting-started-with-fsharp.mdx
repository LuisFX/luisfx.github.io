# Getting Started with F# and Fable

F# and Fable provide a powerful combination for building web applications with a functional-first approach.

## Why F# for Web Development?

F# offers several advantages for web development:

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
- **Immutability**: Predictable code with fewer bugs
- **Expressive Syntax**: Write concise, readable code
- **Functional Patterns**: Leverage functional programming paradigms

## Setting Up Your First Project

Let's walk through setting up a basic F# and Fable project:

```fsharp
// Program.fs
open Browser.Dom

let hello name =
    printfn "Hello, %s!" name

hello "F# Developer"
```

## Using Feliz for React Components

Feliz provides type-safe React bindings for F#:

```fsharp
open Feliz

let counter () =
    let (count, setCount) = React.useState(0)
    
    Html.div [
        Html.h1 [
            prop.text (sprintf "Count: %d" count)
        ]
        Html.button [
            prop.text "Increment"
            prop.onClick (fun _ -> setCount(count + 1))
        ]
    ]
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic understanding of F# and Fable, you can start building more complex applications.
